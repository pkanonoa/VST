   - Document upload functionality
   - Common components and utilities

3. **Module Implementation**
   - Implement each module independently
   - Ensure consistent UI/UX across modules
   - Integrate document management within each module

4. **Integration and Testing**
   - Connect modules together
   - Implement cross-module functionality
   - Comprehensive testing

5. **Packaging and Deployment**
   - Build and optimize for production
   - Package with Electron
   - Create installer for distribution

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Vue.js for Frontend**
   - Component-based architecture for reusability
   - Reactive data binding for efficient updates
   - Vuex for state management

2. **Express.js for Backend**
   - Lightweight and flexible API framework
   - Easy integration with SQLite
   - Middleware support for authentication and file handling

3. **SQLite for Database**
   - File-based database for simplicity
