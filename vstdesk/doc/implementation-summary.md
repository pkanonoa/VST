## Key Implementation Details

### Document Management

Document management is integrated within each module rather than being a separate module. This allows users to upload, view, download, and manage documents directly within the context of shops, apartments, bookings, bills, and expenses.

Key components:
- Reusable document upload component
- Document preview functionality
- Document download and deletion
- Structured storage system

See [Document Management Implementation Guide](document-management-implementation.md) for detailed implementation instructions.

### Check-In/Check-Out Functionality

The Apartment Rental module includes explicit Check-In and Check-Out tracking for bookings. This enables accurate calculation of stay duration, proper billing, and management of apartment availability.

Key features:
- Booking form with check-in/check-out datetime fields
- Check-in and check-out operations
- Calculation of stay duration and amount
- Status tracking (booked, checked-in, checked-out, cancelled)

See [Check-In/Checkout Implementation Guide](check-in-checkout-implementation.md) for detailed implementation instructions.

### Database Schema

The database schema is designed to support all the required functionality while maintaining data integrity and relationships between entities.

Key tables:
- Users
- Shops
- Apartments
- ApartmentBookings
- RentPayments
- WaterBills and WaterBillAllocations
- CurrentBills and CurrentBillAllocations
- ExternalExpenses

See [Architecture Document](architecture.md) for the complete database schema.

### API Structure

The API is organized by module, with each module having its own set of routes and controllers. This ensures a clean separation of concerns and makes the codebase easier to maintain.

Key API endpoints:
- Authentication endpoints
- Shop and apartment endpoints
- Booking and rent payment endpoints
- Water and current bill endpoints
- Expense endpoints
- Report endpoints
- Document endpoints

See [Architecture Document](architecture.md) for the complete API structure.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization

- Follow the component structure outlined in the architecture document
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper error handling
- Write comprehensive documentation

### UI/UX Guidelines

- Follow the design principles in the UI Design Guidelines
- Ensure consistent styling across all modules
- Optimize for desktop use
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for power users

See [UI Design Guidelines](ui-design-guidelines.md) for detailed design principles.

### Testing Strategy

- Write unit tests for all backend APIs
- Create integration tests for module interactions
- Perform UI testing for all user flows
- Implement continuous integration

See [Testing and Deployment Strategy](testing-deployment-strategy.md) for detailed testing guidelines.

## Next Steps

1. Set up the project structure and development environment
2. Implement the database schema
3. Create the core authentication and document management functionality
4. Begin implementing the modules one by one

The detailed todo list in the project provides a step-by-step guide for implementation. Follow this list to ensure all aspects of the application are properly implemented.

## Conclusion

The Rental & Expense Management App provides a comprehensive solution for managing rental properties, utility bills, and expenses. The modular architecture and desktop-optimized design ensure a user-friendly experience for property owners. The integration of document management within each module eliminates the need for a separate document management system, streamlining the workflow.

By following the implementation plan outlined in this document and the detailed guides for each component, the development team can efficiently build a robust and user-friendly application that meets all the requirements.
